# multiple_testing

In p.adjust.R file, I added several recent multiple testing methods to p.adjust package in R. Please refer to the details in p.adjust.pdf.

In SemesterPaper.pdf, I compared the theoretical basis of several multiple comparsion methods, I also carried out simulation study in both independent and dependent cases to compare the performance of these methods in terms of their ability to control the false discoveries and their statistical power. Please refer to the code in simulation.R and main.RMD.
